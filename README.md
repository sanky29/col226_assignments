## Introduction
These were assignments from programming lagauge. I highly encourage you to not use them in your own assignments. 
The assignments involved making lexer, parser, most general unifier, type checker, toy logic interpreter and abstarct machines.

### A1: Vector and matrix artihmetic
First assignment was to make us familier with OCaml environment. Wrote some function involved computing product, addition, inverse
of matrices and vectors.

### A2: Lexer
A simple lexer for toy spreedsheet language was made using OCamllex capable of identifying simple tokens of number and function primitives.

### A3: Parser
Extending the previous assignemnt this assignemnt involved creating grammer for toy spreedsheet language invovling simple arithmetic operations.

### A4: Complete Spreedsheet language
This assignment involved making simple type checker for above toy logic, resolving intermediate representation into final resultant spreedsheet.

### A5: MGU
Goal of this assignment was to find the most general unifier of two expression.

### A4: Toy Logic Interpreter
This was one of the toughest assignemt. The goal was to develop interpreter for toy logic programming language. The idea was to generate intermediate representation and using backtracking and MGU to resolve goal.

### A7: Type Checker
Simple prolog based assigment which checked type of expressions.

### A8: Abstract Machine
Involved making [Kervin Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krivine_machine) and [SECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine) abstract machines.
